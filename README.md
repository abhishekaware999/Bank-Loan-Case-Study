## üìù Description
This project involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns that influence loan default. You will analyze missing data, outliers, data imbalance, correlations, and perform statistical analysis to gain actionable insights that can improve loan approval strategies.

### Key Analytical Tasks:
1. **Handling Missing Data:** Identify and decide the best method to handle missing values in the dataset.
2. **Outlier Detection:** Identify and address potential outliers that may affect data accuracy.
3. **Data Imbalance Analysis:** Assess the distribution of defaulting vs. non-defaulting customers.
4. **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis:** Examine variable distributions and relationships.
5. **Correlation Analysis:** Identify strong indicators of loan default using correlation analysis.

## üîç Data Analytics Tasks

### A. Identifying Missing Data
**Objective:** Ensure data completeness for accurate analysis.
**Task:** Identify missing values and decide the best imputation strategy.
**Hint:** Use Excel functions like COUNT, ISBLANK, and AVERAGE for analysis.
**Graph Suggestion:** Bar chart to visualize missing data proportions.

### B. Outlier Detection
**Objective:** Identify and analyze the impact of outliers.
**Task:** Detect outliers in numerical variables using statistical methods.
**Hint:** Use Excel functions like QUARTILE and IQR to find outliers.
**Graph Suggestion:** Box plots or scatter plots to highlight outliers.

### C. Data Imbalance Analysis
**Objective:** Understand class distribution and its impact on analysis.
**Task:** Determine the ratio of defaulting vs. non-defaulting customers.
**Hint:** Use COUNTIF and SUM functions to compute proportions.
**Graph Suggestion:** Pie chart or bar chart showing class distribution.

### D. Univariate & Bivariate Analysis
**Objective:** Identify key features influencing loan default.
**Task:** Perform descriptive, segmented, and relational analysis.
**Hint:** Use Excel functions like COUNT, AVERAGE, and pivot tables.
**Graph Suggestion:** Histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots.

### E. Correlation Analysis
**Objective:** Find strong predictors of loan default.
**Task:** Compute correlation coefficients for different scenarios.
**Hint:** Use Excel's CORREL function to rank correlations.
**Graph Suggestion:** Heatmaps or correlation matrices with highlighted top factors.
